How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
using FC (in Windows, FileCompare) file1.txt file2.txt helps focus on any difference that I would not have picked up on otherwise or manually

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Well, it would then be easy to reuse parts of the code that I would maybe have discarded in later versions. or show at what point I built a part of the program that should have been broken out.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
By being mindful of your commit schedule, you can commit on logical changes. making it easier to logically compare filesl

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log - shows you the commits in that repo and their titles
git diff - shows you the actual changes between two commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You'd be able to revert if you break something. Also it would be easy to go back to a working state by using git checkout that allows you to checkout previous versions....
