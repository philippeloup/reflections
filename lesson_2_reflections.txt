What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	No commit is automatically created. You have whatever is in the folder not being tracked, but you are on the 'branch master'.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows you to select the files that are going to be commited, before you actually do. It allows for making sure that the correct files get committed.
